									<b>Plan Activities in Advance</b> 
<br>
Popular activities like snorkeling, scuba diving, parasailing, and dolphin cruises can fill up quickly. Booking them early ensures you don’t miss out on the experiences you really want. It also helps you manage your time better so you can enjoy both adventure and relaxation.
<br>
<b> Pack Light but Smart</b>
<br>
Since most travel involves speedboats or seaplanes, it’s better to pack light. Bring essentials like sunscreen, breathable clothes, beachwear, and waterproof phone covers. The Maldives is sunny year-round, so sun protection is very important for a comfortable trip.
<br>
<b>
Respect Local Culture on Public Islands </b>
<br>
If you're visiting local islands, remember that Maldives is a Muslim country. Modest clothing is required in public areas, but bikini beaches and resort islands allow normal swimwear. Knowing these rules helps you stay respectful and enjoy your trip without any issues.
<br>
<b>Enjoy the Water — Safely </b>
<br>
The Maldives has some of the clearest water in the world, perfect for swimming and snorkeling. However, always listen to safety instructions and avoid going too far from the shore alone. The ocean is beautiful but strong currents can appear unexpectedly.
